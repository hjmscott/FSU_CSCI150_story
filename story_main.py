DESCRIPTION:
Simple program that prints out a story created through collaboration.
Students add a line within the story() method.
Used to introduce Github to students at CSU Fresno in CSCI150 -- Software Engineering
Made by Hannah Scott (the lab TA) on July 21, 2016


INSTRUCTIONS:
0. Run in Python 3 (NOT 2!)
1. Add at least one line to the story by appending a string to the list
in the story() method below. You can run (f5 in IDLE, or just run story_main.py) to see what's there so far.
2. Save the file in the repository.
3. Commit the change.
4. Get points. 

RULES:
1. Don't do anything illegal / disturbingly immoral (e.g. detailed murder plans, giving away gma's secret cookie recipe)

2. Don't be super mean to anyone in the class.
(Celebrities are fair game. Except Trump. I'm sick of hearing about Trump.)
(Probably you shouldn't say anything about Clinton either. Or Obama. I don't want to P.O. the Secret Service.)
(And I guess you shouldn't say anything about Kanye West, Kim Kardashian or Taylor Swift--God knows what could happen.)
(Actually, probably you should avoid celebrities. Unless they are super cool.)

3. Don't be super weird, like to the point that it ruins it and makes things awk for everyone. (just ... OK?)

4. If you try to run this and it doesn't work, you can get credit for fixing it
instead of adding a line to the story.
(Just put a note about what you fixed in the code when you commit.)

5. You can add to any of the lists in the rand_ methods e.g. rand_adj()
*****as long as you follow the rules above.

def story():
    '''
    (Added by Hannah S.)
    You can use add_line("your contribution") to append a string as demonstrated,
    or lines.append("your contribution")
    You can add import lines, methods, etc. to the program if you are feeling creative.
    And you can call any of the rand_ methods below if you want to use the mad-lib features provided.
    Or, you can just add a boring old line.
    See rules outlined at the top of this file if you are uncertain.

    Newlines will be inserted for you.
